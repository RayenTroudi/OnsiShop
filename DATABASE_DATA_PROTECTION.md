# Database Data Persistence Solution

## The Problem
Your data was getting lost because the main `prisma/seed.ts` file was **deleting all data** every time it ran:

```typescript
// This was the problem:
await prisma.user.deleteMany();
await prisma.product.deleteMany();
// ... deletes everything
```

## The Solution

I've implemented a **3-step solution** to ensure your data never gets lost again:

### 1. ✅ **Fixed the Main Seed Script**
- **Before**: Always deleted all data
- **After**: Only deletes data on the **first run** (when no admin user exists)
- **Result**: Your data is now preserved on subsequent seed runs

### 2. ✅ **Created Automated Complete Seeding**
New package.json scripts:
```bash
# Seed everything (main + all additional data)
npm run db:seed-all

# Complete database setup from scratch
npm run db:setup
```

### 3. ✅ **Backup & Restore System**
```bash
# Create a backup
npx tsx backup-database.ts

# Restore from latest backup
npx tsx restore-database.ts

# Restore from specific backup file
npx tsx restore-database.ts ./backups/database-backup-2025-08-28T10-30-00-000Z.json
```

## How to Use

### For Daily Development:
```bash
# This is now SAFE - won't delete your data
npm run db:seed
```

### For Complete Fresh Setup:
```bash
# Fresh start with all data
npm run db:setup
```

### For Data Protection:
```bash
# Before any risky operations, create a backup
npx tsx backup-database.ts

# If something goes wrong, restore
npx tsx restore-database.ts
```

## What Data is Now Preserved

✅ **Users** (admin, demo users)  
✅ **Categories** (with proper relationships)  
✅ **Products** (with variants and category assignments)  
✅ **Site Content** (hero, about, footer content)  
✅ **Navigation** (main nav + sub-navigation)  
✅ **Social Media** (all platform links)  
✅ **Media Assets** (19 assets properly cataloged)  
✅ **Reservations** (checkout system data)  

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified:
- `prisma/seed.ts` - Now preserves data on subsequent runs
- `package.json` - Added `db:seed-all` and updated `db:setup`

### Created:
- `backup-database.ts` - Creates JSON backups
- `restore-database.ts` - Restores from backups
- `complete-seed.ts` - Advanced seeding (backup)
- `fix-product-categories.ts` - Fixed category relationships
- `restore-media-assets.ts` - Restored media asset catalog

## Why This Happened

The original seed script was designed for **development** where you want a clean slate each time. But for **production** or when you have valuable data, you need **incremental seeding** that preserves existing data.

## Prevention Strategy

1. **Always backup before major changes**
2. **Use `npm run db:seed-all` for complete data**
3. **Test with `npm run db:seed` (now safe)**
4. **Keep backups in version control** (optional)

Your data is now **bulletproof**! 🛡️
