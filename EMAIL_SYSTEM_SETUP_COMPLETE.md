## üìß Email Configuration Complete

The email system has been successfully configured for your Onsi Shop application with the following features:

### ‚úÖ What's Configured

   - Email Provider: Gmail SMTP
   - Email Address: `onsi@gmail.com`
   - App Password: `bgge exoy syid apbm`
   
2. **Order Notification Emails**

   - **Customer Confirmation**: Sent to customer's email address with order details

3. **Branding & Localization**
   - All emails use "Onsi Shop" branding
   - Currency displayed as "DT" (Tunisian Dinar)
   - Professional HTML templates with order details

### üìß Email Templates

#### Admin Notification Email

### üöÄ How It Works

When a customer places an order through your checkout system:

2. **Admin notification** is automatically sent to `onsi@gmail.com`
3. **Customer confirmation** is automatically sent to customer's email
4. Both emails include full order details with DT pricing

### üß™ Testing

Use the test script at `scripts/test-email.ts` to test the email system:

```bash
cd /d/OnsiShop
npx tsx scripts/test-email.ts
```
