# MongoDB M0 Connection Limit Fix

## Issue
MongoDB Atlas M0 (free tier) cluster has a **25 connection limit**. Your application exceeded this threshold, causing connection errors and the alert email.

## Immediate Solution

### 1. Run Emergency Cleanup (RIGHT NOW)
```bash
npm run db:emergency
```
This will immediately clean up idle connections and reduce your connection count.

### 2. Restart Your Application
```bash
# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 3. Monitor Connections
```bash
npm run db:status    # Check current status
npm run db:monitor   # Start continuous monitoring
```

## Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Optimized MongoDB Connection Settings
**File**: `src/lib/mongodb.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- **Reduced `maxPoolSize`** from 5 to **3 connections**
- **Set `minPoolSize`** to **0** (start with no connections)  
- **Reduced `maxIdleTimeMS`** to **5 seconds** (very aggressive cleanup)
- **Shortened timeouts** for faster connection recycling
- **Disabled retryReads** to reduce connection attempts
- **Changed write concern** from `majority` to `1` for M0 optimization

### 2. Enhanced Connection Monitoring
**File**: `src/lib/connectionMonitor.ts`

**Changes Made**:
- **Reduced `MAX_CONNECTIONS`** from 20 to **15**
- **Reduced `CLEANUP_INTERVAL`** from 5 minutes to **2 minutes**  
- **Lowered `WARNING_THRESHOLD`** from 15 to **10**

### 3. Added Emergency Cleanup Script
**File**: `scripts/emergency-cleanup.js`

**Features**:
- Immediate connection count check
- Force cleanup idle connections  
- Before/after comparison
- Next steps recommendations

### 4. Created Connection Cleanup Middleware
**File**: `src/lib/withMongoCleanup.ts`

**Features**:
- Automatic cleanup after API calls
- Error-triggered cleanup
- Connection monitoring wrapper

## New NPM Scripts

```bash
npm run db:emergency  # Emergency cleanup (use now!)
npm run db:status     # Check connection count
npm run db:monitor    # Start connection monitoring  
npm run db:cleanup    # Manual cleanup
```

## Connection Thresholds for M0 Cluster

| Connections | Status | Action |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| 0-10 | ✅ **Healthy** | Normal operation |
| 11-15 | ⚠️ **Warning** | Monitor closely |
| 16-20 | 🚨 **Critical** | Auto cleanup triggered |
| 21-25 | 🔥 **Limit Reached** | Emergency cleanup needed |
| 25+ | ❌ **Over Limit** | New connections blocked |

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Regular Monitoring
```bash
# Add to your development workflow
npm run db:monitor
```

### 2. Automatic Cleanup
The app now automatically:
- Closes idle connections after 5 seconds
- Cleans up every 2 minutes
- Forces cleanup when approaching limits

### 3. Connection-Aware Development
- Use `withConnectionMonitoring()` for database operations
- Implement proper error handling
- Close connections explicitly when possible

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. Upgrade MongoDB Plan
- **M10 Cluster**: 250 connections (~$9/month)
- **M20 Cluster**: 500 connections (~$25/month)

### 2. Connection Pooling Optimization
```javascript
// In your API routes
import { withConnectionCleanup } from '@/lib/withMongoCleanup';

export const GET = withConnectionCleanup(async (req) => {
  // Your API logic here
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
});
```

### 3. Database Architecture Review
- Reduce API calls frequency
- Implement client-side caching
- Use connection sharing patterns

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Daily Health Check
```bash
npm run db:status
```

### Continuous Monitoring  
```bash
npm run db:monitor
```

### MongoDB Atlas Dashboard
1. Login to MongoDB Atlas
2. Go to your cluster
3. Check "Metrics" tab
4. Monitor "Connections" graph

## Emergency Contacts

If connections are still high after these fixes:

1. **Restart your entire application**
2. **Check for connection leaks** in your code
3. **Consider upgrading** to M10+ cluster
4. **Contact MongoDB Support** for M0 issues

## Success Metrics

After implementing these fixes, you should see:
- ✅ Connection count below 15
- ✅ No more connection limit emails
- ✅ Faster database operations
- ✅ Better error handling
