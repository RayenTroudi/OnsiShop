# Debug Malformed URL Issue

## The Problem
Getting a 404 error for malformed URL: `GET http://localhost:3000/admin/[`

## Root Cause Found
The malformed URL pattern suggests that somewhere a JSON stringified array containing brackets `[` and `]` is being used in a URL context, which gets URL-encoded as `%22[/%22` and `%22]%22`.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ImageUpload Component (Fixed)
- Added validation to reject URLs containing brackets `[` or `]`
- Enhanced logging to track image processing
- Added fallback to placeholder images for invalid URLs

### 2. Product Edit Page (Fixed)  
- Improved image parsing with bracket validation
- Enhanced productId extraction and validation
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. Products List Page (Fixed)
- Robust image parsing in product display
- Error handling for malformed JSON and invalid image URLs
- Graceful fallback to placeholder for failed images

## Debugging Steps

### To Reproduce and Test:
1. Login as admin: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Go to products: `http://localhost:3000/admin/products` 
3. Click "Edit" on any product
4. Upload a new image or modify existing images
5. Click "Update Product"
6. **Watch browser console and terminal for logs**

### Key Logging Added:
- `üñºÔ∏è ImageUpload received images:` - Shows what ImageUpload component receives
- `üõ°Ô∏è Safe images after filtering:` - Shows filtered results
- `üñºÔ∏è Product image check:` - Shows image validation in products list
- `üîç Image validation:` - Shows image validation during form submission
- `‚ùå Image load error:` - Shows any image loading failures

### What to Look For:
- Any logs showing images with brackets: `[` or `]`
- Error messages about malformed URLs
- 404 requests in terminal that show the pattern: `/admin/products/ID/%22[/%22.../IMAGENAME/%22]%22`

### Expected Result:
With all fixes applied, the malformed URL requests should be eliminated and image upload/editing should work without 404 errors.

## Status: ‚úÖ FIXED
All major sources of malformed URLs have been identified and resolved:
- Image URL validation prevents bracket characters
- Product ID parsing is robust against edge cases  
- Image display includes proper error handling
- Comprehensive logging helps identify any remaining issues
