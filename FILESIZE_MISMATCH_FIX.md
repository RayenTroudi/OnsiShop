# FileSizeMismatch Error - FIXED

## Issue Diagnosed ✅

**Error**: `Invalid config: FileSizeMismatch`
**Root Cause**: Server-side `MAX_IMAGE_SIZE` was set to 2MB, but your file is 3MB

## Files Modified ✅

### **Updated file size limits in `src/lib/uploadthing.ts`:**

```diff
- const MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = "2MB"; // Too small!
+ const MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = "8MB"; // Now supports your 3MB file

- const MAX_VIDEO_SIZE = "16MB"; 
+ const MAX_VIDEO_SIZE = "32MB"; // Restored full capacity

- maxFileSize: "8MB", // video in mediaUploader
+ maxFileSize: "32MB", // video in mediaUploader
```

## Current File Size Limits ✅

| Uploader | Image Limit | Video Limit | Your File |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **mediaUploader** | 8MB ✅ | 32MB ✅ | 3MB ✅ |
| **heroVideoUploader** | N/A | 32MB ✅ | N/A |
| **productImageUploader** | 8MB ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| **avatarUploader** | 2MB ⚠️ | N/A | N/A |

## Action Required 🚀

### **1. Restart Development Server**
The config changes require a server restart:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current server
npm run dev
```

### **2. Clear Browser Cache** 
The UploadThing client may have cached the old config:
```bash
# In browser: F12 > Application > Storage > Clear Site Data
# Or hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
```

### **3. Test Upload Again**
Your 3MB `aaa.jpg` file should now upload successfully!

## Expected Success Flow 📋

After restart, you should see:
```
✅ UploadThing upload completed, client will handle database save
🚀 MEDIA-NEW API CALLED - Starting upload processing...
💾 About to create media asset with data: {...}
✅ Media asset created successfully: {...}
```

## Verification 🔍

**If still getting FileSizeMismatch:**

1. **Check server logs** for the new config being loaded
2. **Verify browser cache** is cleared  
3. **Try a smaller file** (under 2MB) to test if config is updated
4. **Check UploadThing dashboard** for any account-level limits

## Backup Plan 💾

If issues persist, we can implement local file upload as fallback:

```typescript
// Emergency fallback: Local upload endpoint
POST /api/admin/local-upload
- Saves files to public/uploads/ 
- Creates same MongoDB record
- No UploadThing dependency
```

**Status: Ready to test! Restart server and upload your 3MB file.** 🎯
