## 🧪 Technical Implementation

### Image Loading Strategy
```tsx
// Before (Lazy Loading)
<Image 
  loading="lazy" 
  priority={false}
  // Complex intersection observers
/>

// After (Direct UploadThing)
<Image 
  priority={true}
  quality={90}
  unoptimized={url.startsWith('data:')}
  // Direct CDN loading
/>
```

### Content Fetching Pattern
```tsx
// Simplified fetch pattern used across all components
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchContent = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/content');
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (result.success && result.data) {
      setContent({
        backgroundImage: result.data.section_background_image,
        // Other content fields...
      });
    }
  };
  
  fetchContent();
}, []);
```
