# Promotion Image Upload Fix Summary

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### 1. **API Response Parsing**
- **Problem**: Promotions component was incorrectly accessing API response data
- **Fix**: Updated to use `result.data['promotion.backgroundImage']` instead of `data['promotion.backgroundImage']`

### 2. **Real-time Updates**
- **Problem**: Website wasn't refreshing when admin uploaded new images
- **Fix**: Added Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time content updates

### 3. **Browser Caching**
- **Problem**: Browser was caching old content and images
- **Fix**: Added cache-busting parameters and no-cache headers

### 4. **Image Rendering**
- **Problem**: Next.js Image component wasn't re-rendering with new sources
- **Fix**: Added `key` prop to force re-rendering and `unoptimized` for uploaded images

### 5. **File Input Behavior**
- **Problem**: File input causing unwanted downloads in VS Code
- **Fix**: Enhanced event handling and added proper preventDefault calls
